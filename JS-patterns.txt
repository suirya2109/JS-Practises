ðŸ”‘ Common Algorithm Patterns (for LeetCode + Interviews)
1. Two Pointers

When to use: Arrays, linked lists, searching for pairs, substrings.

Examples:

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Valid Palindrome

Container With Most Water

2. Sliding Window

When to use: Subarrays/substrings with conditions (sum, length, distinct chars).

Examples:

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Minimum Window Substring

Maximum Average Subarray

3. Fast & Slow Pointers (Cycle Detection)

When to use: Linked list cycle, middle of list, palindrome check.

Examples:

Linked List Cycle

Find Middle Node in Linked List

4. Merge Intervals

When to use: Interval problems (meeting rooms, merging ranges).

Examples:

Merge Intervals

Insert Interval

5. Cyclic Sort (Index-based placement)

When to use: Numbers in range [1â€¦n].

Examples:

Find Missing Number

Find Duplicate Number

6. In-place Reversal of Linked List

When to use: Reverse sublists, detect palindromes.

Examples:

Reverse Linked List

Reverse Nodes in k-Group

7. Tree Traversals (DFS & BFS)

When to use: Binary tree, graph traversal.

Examples:

Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (BFS)

Path Sum (DFS)

8. Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS + Union Find)

When to use: Connectivity, islands, shortest path.

Examples:

Number of Islands

Clone Graph

Course Schedule

9. Binary Search

When to use: Sorted arrays, searching ranges.

Examples:

Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Find First and Last Position in Sorted Array

10. Heap / Priority Queue

When to use: Top-K problems, scheduling, shortest paths.

Examples:

Kth Largest Element in Array

Merge K Sorted Lists

11. Backtracking

When to use: Combinations, permutations, subsets.

Examples:

N-Queens

Subsets / Permutations

Word Search

12. Dynamic Programming (DP)

When to use: Overlapping subproblems, optimal choices.

Types:

1D DP â†’ Fibonacci, House Robber

2D DP â†’ Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance

Knapsack DP â†’ Partition Equal Subset Sum

13. Greedy

When to use: Interval scheduling, activity selection, minimum steps.

Examples:

Jump Game

Gas Station

14. Topological Sort

When to use: Scheduling, dependency resolution (DAGs).

Examples:

Course Schedule

Alien Dictionary

15. Bit Manipulation

When to use: XOR tricks, subsets, single number.

Examples:

Single Number

Subsets with Bitmasking

16. Mathematical Patterns

When to use: GCD/LCM, combinatorics, prime checks.

Examples:

Pow(x, n)

Sieve of Eratosthenes
