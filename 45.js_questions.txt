5. Throttling 
6. Currying 
7. IIFE 
8. Generators 
9. Event Looping 
10. Event Bubbling 


1) DOM?
The DOM represents the web page as a tree-like structure.
--------------
2) Object 
Which is a collection of key-value pairs. Objects can contain other objects, functions, and data types. 
let person = { 
name: "John", 
age: 30, 
isStudent: false 
};
__________

3) Arrays 
Which is a list-like structure, used to store multiple values in an ordered fashion. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed. 
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
________

4) Function 
A function is a block of reusable code. In JavaScript functions are treated as objects and can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions. 
function greet(name) { 
return 'Hello, ${name}`; 
}
________

5) NAN
Special JavaScript value that checks if a given value is not a Number.
________

6) undefined
let a; 
console.log(a); 
The variable a has been declared but not initialized hence 
it is given the default value of undefined.
__________

7) NUll 
let b = null; 
console.log(b); 
Which has been declared null for the time being.

b = "Now assigned"; console.log(b); 
But it can be assigned a value later. 
Now assigned.
________

8) What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)? 
An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a JavaScript function that is defined and executed immediately after it's created.
________

9)What are Higher-Order Functions? Can you give an example? 

Higher-order functions are functions that can either take other functions as arguments or return a function as a result.
__________

10) Explain the Observer pattern and how it relates to JavaScript 
The Observer Pattern is a design pattern in which an object (called the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (called observers) and notifies them of any changes, typically through a broadcast mechanism.

Madhan gowri Subject and audiences are the observer.
__________

11)Explain the concept of Promises in JavaScript? 
Promises handle asynchronous tasks in JavaScript by providing a more readable and structured approach than callbacks for handling outputs 
Pending 
Fulfilled 
Rejected
__________

12)What is the difference between a promise and an async/await function? 
1)async/await 
async/await is a cleaner, more readable way to handle Promises 
2)promise 
promises are the underlying mechanism.
__________

13) Explaination about aysyc and await ?
What is the use of async and await in JavaScript? 
async 
Declaring a function with async makes it return a promise 
await 
It pauses the execution of the code until the promise it's waiting for is resolved, then returns the resolved value.
__________

14) What is the difference between call, apply, and bind? 
1)Call 
Invokes the function immediately, with this set to thisArg, and accepts arguments one by one.
2)Apply 
Invokes the function immediately, with this set to thisArg, but takes arguments as an array.
3)Bind 
Returns a new function with this set to thisArg, and any preset arguments, but doesn't invoke it immediately.
__________

15) Explain call, apply and bind?
call 
Runs the function immediately, passing each argument separately. 
apply 
Runs the function immediately, passing arguments as an array.
bind 
Creates a new function with preset this and arguments, which you can call later.
__________

16) Event Loop 
A technique that allows you to manage events for multiple elements more efficiently by using a single event.
listener on a common parent element rather than on each individual child element.
__________

17)What is Event Delegation? 
A technique that allows you to manage events for multiple elements more efficiently by using a single event listener on a common parent element rather than on each individual child element.
*Improves Performance 
*Handles Dynamic Elements 
*Cleaner Code
__________

18)Describe the purpose of the reduce method in arrays?
The reduce() method in JavaScript is used to reduce an array to a single value by applying a function on each element in the array.
__________

19)Explain the concept of Currying in JavaScript? 
Currying is a concept in functional programming where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each accepting a single argument.
__________

20)What are Weak maps and Weak sets in JavaScript? 
* Weak maps 
A WeakMap is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys are required to be objects.
* Weak sets 
A collection of unique object references that only stores objects and does not allow any primitives.
__________

21)How does JavaScript handle Memory management? 
a)Memory Allocation
1) Stack Memory 
Numbers 
Strings  
Booleans 
Null  
Undefined 
Functions 

2)Heap Memory
Objects
Arrays 
Functions 

b)Garbage Collection 
X   10 
name   "aarya"
flag   true
table_joker  null
book_data    { "Lily", 90} 
 
Variables    References
__________

22) What is JavaScript's Strict mode, and how is it enabled? 
It enforces various rules to make your code cleaner and more secure
