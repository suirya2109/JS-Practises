Nice! Practicing JavaScript is a great move, especially as a front-end developer. Here are some fun and structured ways to level up:

🧠 Core Practice Areas

💡 JavaScript Fundamentals

Variables, scopes, closures

Functions (declaration, expressions, arrow functions)

Arrays & Objects

Promises, async/await

DOM manipulation

🧩 Algorithm Practice (especially for interviews)

LeetCode: Stick with Top 150 questions

Codewars or HackerRank: Focus on 6–7 kyu JavaScript problems

Practice these categories:

Arrays & Strings

Recursion

Hash Maps

Sorting & Searching

Sliding Window / Two Pointers

🎯 Real-World Mini Projects

A weather app using fetch API

To-do list with localStorage

Form validation tool

Image carousel

Modal / Tooltip / Accordion components

🛠 DOM + Event Handling

Make everything from scratch using Vanilla JS before using Angular/React.

Example: Build your own lightbox or dropdown menu.

📚 Advanced Concepts

Closures, Currying, Debouncing, Throttling

Event loop & Call Stack

ES6+ features (destructuring, spread/rest, modules)

🗓️ How about a schedule like this?

Monday–Friday: 1 LeetCode problem/day (easy to medium)

Saturday: Build or improve a mini-project

Sunday: Review JS theory + refactor old code

👨‍💻 Want me to send you one challenge daily or suggest a JS project idea each week? I can also create a personal roadmap if you’d like.
